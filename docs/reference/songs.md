## Other Songs

In 2019, Google removed various Geometry Dash clients from their playstore and RobTop accidentally uploaded a development build of update 2.2 when resolving the issue. In the game files, 2 songs could be found, one of which isn't in the final release, that being Firebird by MDK, which, according to RobTop, was not meant to be a real level.
